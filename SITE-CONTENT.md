## Problem Section

**Section Headline:**  
You're Losing Money Every Time You Miss a Call

**Problem Cards (3):**

### Card 1: Missed Calls = Lost Revenue
While you're on a job, leads are calling. If you don't answer, they call the next guy. That's money walking out the door.

### Card 2: Your Customer List is Collecting Dust
You've got hundreds of past customers who'd hire you again - if you ever reached out. But who has time for that?

### Card 3: Follow-Up is a Full-Time Job
Texting leads, sending reminders, confirming appointments... it never ends. You didn't start a business to be a receptionist.

**— Ryan, Ryan's Epoxy Floors**

## Industry Success Stories Section

**Section Headline:**  
See What's Possible in Your Industry

**Section Intro:**  
Every business is different. Here's what Human Led AI looks like in action across different trades.

---

### Story 1: The "I'm On The Job Site" Problem
**Best for:** Roofers, Epoxy, Landscapers - anyone who works with their hands

**The Story:**  
"Before this, I was missing leads because I was up on a ladder or covered in epoxy. By the time I called them back, they'd already hired someone else. Now, the system calls them immediately, qualifies them to make sure they aren't just tire-kickers, and puts them on my calendar. I just look at my phone and see where my next appointment is. It's like having a full-time sales manager without the payroll."

**— Mike T., Precision Epoxy & Flooring**

**Key Outcome:** Never miss a lead while you're doing the actual work.

---

### Story 2: The "Quality Over Quantity" Problem
**Best for:** High-ticket services - Pools, Retaining Walls, Custom Builds

**The Story:**  
"I don't have time to drive 45 minutes for a quote just to find out the homeowner isn't serious. Human Led AI changed ALL that. The voice agent actually speaks to them and confirms they are ready to go before I ever start my truck. I'm doing less driving and closing more deals because the people I meet with are actually pre-sold."

**— Sarah J., Apex Retaining Walls**

**Key Outcome:** Stop wasting time on tire-kickers. Meet only with serious buyers.

---

### Story 3: The "Revenue & Scale" Problem
**Best for:** Businesses ready to grow aggressively

**The Story:**  
"We were generating leads, but we couldn't follow up fast enough to convert them. This system chases every single lead for us—over and over again—until they book or say no. It's relentless in the best way possible. We've doubled our estimates per week simply because we stopped letting leads slip through the cracks."

**— David R., Premier Roofing Solutions**

**Key Outcome:** Turn lead leakage into booked appointments. Scale without adding staff.

**CTA Below Stories:**  
"Which one sounds like you? Let's talk." → Book a Demo button

**Design Note for Claude Code:**  
- Display these as cards or tabs that users can click through
- Each story should feel like a mini case study
- Use icons or imagery that represents each trade (ladder, truck, calendar)
- Keep the "Key Outcome" line visually distinct (bold or highlighted)

## Copy Notes for Claude Code

1. **Keep headlines short and punchy** - No more than 10 words
2. **Benefits over features** - "Appointments on your calendar" not "Calendar integration"
3. **Address the competitor fear** - Use "your competition" language
4. **Sound human** - This is "Human Led AI" after all. Warm, direct, not robotic.
5. **CTAs should be action-oriented** - "Book a Demo" not "Learn More"
