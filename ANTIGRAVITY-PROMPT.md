Automate Your Growth Without Losing the Human Touch.

**Buttons:**
- "Book a Demo" (primary, action color) → href="#" <!-- TODO: GHL booking link -->

**Social proof line below buttons:**

---

### 3. PROBLEM SECTION (Dark or alt background)

**Section Headline:**
You're Losing Money Every Time You Miss a Call

**Three problem cards:**

**Card 1: Missed Calls = Lost Revenue**
While you're on a job, leads are calling. If you don't answer, they call the next guy. That's money walking out the door.

**Card 2: Your Customer List is Collecting Dust**
You've got hundreds of past customers who'd hire you again - if you ever reached out. But who has time for that?

**Card 3: Follow-Up is a Full-Time Job**
Texting leads, sending reminders, confirming appointments... it never ends. You didn't start a business to be a receptionist.

---

### 4. SOLUTION SECTION

**Section Headline:**
What If Every Call Was Answered and Every Lead Was Booked?

**Description paragraph:**
Human Led AI gives you an AI-powered team member that handles your calls, texts, and follow-ups - 24 hours a day, 7 days a week. No sick days. No missed calls. Just booked appointments on your calendar.

**Four benefit points (with icons):**

1. **Every Call Answered**
   Your AI agent picks up instantly, qualifies the lead, and books the appointment.

2. **Automatic Follow-Up**
   Missed the call? No problem. AI texts them back, answers questions, and gets them scheduled.

3. **Reactivate Your Customer Base**
   Turn your old customer list into new revenue. AI reaches out and books repeat business.

4. **Appointments on Your Calendar**
   You show up, do the work, get paid. The AI handles everything else.

---

### 5. HOW IT WORKS SECTION

**Section Headline:**
Three Steps to a Full Calendar

**Step 1: We Build Your AI Agent**
We set up a custom AI voice agent trained on your business, your services, and your voice. It knows what questions to ask and how to book the right jobs.

**Step 2: AI Handles Every Conversation**
Calls, texts, follow-ups - your AI agent works 24/7. It answers, qualifies, and books appointments directly to your calendar.

**Step 3: You Show Up and Close**
Your calendar fills up with qualified appointments. You focus on doing the work and getting paid.

**CTA Button:** "See It In Action" → Try It Yourself link

---

### 6. SERVICES / USE CASES SECTION

**Section Headline:**
Built for Businesses That Can't Afford to Miss a Call

**Four use case cards (clickable/expandable):**

**Inbound Call Handling**
Never miss another call. Your AI answers instantly, qualifies the lead, and books the appointment - even at 2am.

**Missed Call Text-Back**
If someone hangs up or you're unavailable, AI immediately texts them to continue the conversation and get them scheduled.

**Database Reactivation**
Got a list of past customers? AI reaches out with personalized messages and books repeat business on autopilot.

**Lead Generation (Add-On)**
Need more leads? We can fill your pipeline with targeted leads for your service area. AI handles them from first contact to booked appointment.

---

### 7. INDUSTRY SUCCESS STORIES SECTION

**Section Headline:**
See What's Possible in Your Industry

**Intro text:**
Every business is different. Here's what Human Led AI looks like in action across different trades.

**Three story cards (tabbed or carousel):**

---

**Story 1: The "On The Job Site" Problem**
*Best for: Roofers, Epoxy, Landscapers*

"Before this, I was missing customer calls because I was covered in epoxy. By the time I called them back, they'd already hired someone else. Now, the system calls them immediately, qualifies them to make sure they aren't just tire-kickers, and puts them on my calendar. I just look at my phone and see where my next appointment is. It's like having a full-time sales manager without the payroll."

— Mike T., Precision Epoxy & Flooring

**Key Outcome:** Never miss a lead while you're doing the actual work.

---

**Story 2: The "Quality Over Quantity" Problem**
*Best for: Pools, Retaining Walls, Custom Builds*

"I don't have time to drive 45 minutes for a quote just to find out the homeowner isn't serious. Human Led AI's voice agents changed ALL that. The voice agent actually speaks to them and confirms they are ready to go before I ever start my truck. I'm doing less driving and closing more deals because the people I meet with are actually pre-sold."

— Sarah J., Apex Retaining Walls

**Key Outcome:** Stop wasting time on tire-kickers. Meet only with serious buyers.

---

**Story 3: The "Revenue & Scale" Problem**
*Best for: Businesses ready to grow*

"We were generating leads, but we couldn't follow up fast enough to have them as clients. This system chases every single lead for us—over and over again—until they book or say no. It's relentless in the best way possible. We've doubled our estimates per week simply because we stopped letting leads slip through the cracks."

— David R., Premier Roofing Solutions

**Key Outcome:** Turn lead leakage into booked appointments. Scale without adding staff.

---

**CTA:** "Which one sounds like you? Let's talk." → Book a Demo

---

### 8. TESTIMONIALS SECTION

**Section Headline:**
Real Results from Real Businesses

**Featured Testimonial:**
"Since setting up the AI agent, I haven't missed a single call. My calendar is totally full and I can focus on the actual work instead of playing phone tag all day."
