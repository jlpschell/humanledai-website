## Brand Voice & Messaging

### Headline
**"Automate Your Growth Without Losing the Human Touch."**

### Subheadline
**"Stop losing leads to your competition. AI voice agents that answer 24/7 and put appointments on your calendar."**

### Tone Guidelines
- **Direct and clear** - No jargon, no fluff. Speak like a contractor would.
- **Confident but not arrogant** - We know this works, but we're not pushy.
- **Results-focused** - Always tie back to booked appointments and revenue.
- **Human** - Despite being AI-focused, emphasize the human element. AI handles the busy work so humans can do human work.

### Words We Use
- "Booked appointments" (not "leads" or "conversions")
- "Your calendar" (makes it tangible)
- "24/7" (emphasizes always-on)
- "Never miss" (addresses the fear)
- "Your competition" (external enemy, not their fault)

### Words We Avoid
- "Cutting-edge" or "revolutionary" (overused, meaningless)
- "Synergy" or corporate speak
- "AI-powered" as the lead (AI is the tool, not the benefit)
- "Cheap" or "affordable" (we're premium)

## Technical Preferences

**For Claude Code - Follow These Rules:**

1. **Keep it simple** - Jay is not a coder. Explanations in plain English, not dev speak.
2. **Step-by-step for terminal work** - If Jay needs to run commands, break it into numbered steps.
3. **Aggressive, demanding code** - Code that installs cleanly and works. No half-measures.
4. **Explain your reasoning** - Brief explanation of WHY you're doing something helps Jay learn.
5. **Goal-first planning** - Start with the end result, then work backward to steps.

## Current Status

- **Phase:** Testing / Pre-launch
- **Niche:** Not locked yet - targeting small businesses broadly while testing
- **GHL Setup:** In progress (calendar system exists but not fully configured)
- **Website:** Needs to be built (this project)

## Reference Site

**Model After:** https://www.bookedin.ai/  
- Similar structure and flow

- Include video placeholder sections for future Remotion-generated content
