      "Before this, I was missing customer calls because I was covered in epoxy. By the time I called them back, they'd already hired someone else. Now, the system calls them immediately, qualifies them to make sure they aren't just tire-kickers, and puts them on my calendar. I just look at my phone and see where my next appointment is. It's like having a full-time sales manager without the payroll.",

The voice agent actually speaks to them and confirms they are ready to go before I ever start my truck. I'm doing less driving and closing more deals because the people I meet with are actually pre-sold.",
